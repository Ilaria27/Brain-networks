abstract = {Schizophrenia, as a psychiatric disorder, has recognized brain alterations both at the structural and at the functional magnetic resonance imaging level. The developing field of connectomics has attracted much attention as it allows researchers to take advantage of powerful tools of network analysis in order to study structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia. Many methods have been proposed to identify biomarkers in schizophrenia, focusing mainly on improving the classification performance or performing statistical comparisons between groups. However, the stability of biomarkers selection has been for long overlooked in the connectomics field. In this study, we follow a machine learning approach where the identification of biomarkers is addressed as a feature selection problem for a classification task. We perform a recursive feature elimination and support vector machines (RFE-SVM) approach to identify the most meaningful biomarkers from the structural, functional, and multi-modal connectomes of healthy controls and patients. Furthermore, the stability of the retrieved biomarkers is assessed across different subsamplings of the dataset, allowing us to identify the affected core of the pathology. Considering our technique altogether, it demonstrates a principled way to achieve both accurate and stable biomarkers while highlighting the importance of multi-modal approaches to brain pathology as they tend to reveal complementary information.}

abstract = {Graph classification is a problem with practical applications in many different domains.
To solve this problem, one usually calculates certain graph statistics (i.e., graph
features) that help discriminate between graphs of different classes. When calculating
such features, most existing approaches process the entire graph. In a graphlet-based
approach, for instance, the entire graph is processed to get the total count of different
graphlets or subgraphs. In many real-world applications, however, graphs can be noisy
with discriminative patterns confined to certain regions in the graph only. In this
work, we study the problem of attention-based graph classification. The use of attention
allows us to focus on small but informative parts of the graph, avoiding noise in
the rest of the graph. We present a novel RNN model, called the Graph Attention Model
(GAM), that processes only a portion of the graph by adaptively selecting a sequence
of "informative" nodes. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show
that the proposed method is competitive against various well-known methods in graph
classification even though our method is limited to only a portion of the graph.},

@article{Rogers2010ECFP,
  abstract = { Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are a novel class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization. Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs were developed specifically for structure-activity modeling. ECFPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature. },

abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.}

abstract = {Over the past decade, machine learning techniques and in particular predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences, from drug delivery systems to medical imaging, have become one of the most important methods of assisting researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of issues in their entirety and solving complex medical problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low- to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85\%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common causes of dementia, is a severe irreversible
neurodegenerative disease that results in loss of mental functions. The transitional
stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and AD, mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), has been widely regarded as a suitable time for possible therapeutic
intervention. The challenging task of MCI detection is therefore of great clinical
importance, where the key is to effectively fuse predictive information from multiple
heterogeneous data sources collected from the patients. In this paper, we propose
a framework to fuse multiple data modalities for predictive modeling using deep matrix
factorization, which explores the non-linear interactions among the modalities and
exploits such interactions to transfer knowledge and enable high performance prediction.
Specifically, the proposed collective deep matrix factorization decomposes all modalities
simultaneously to capture non-linear structures of the modalities in a supervised
manner, and learns a modality specific component for each modality and a modality
invariant component across all modalities. The modality invariant component serves
as a compact feature representation of patients that has high predictive power. The
modality specific components provide an effective means to explore imaging genetics,
yielding insights into how imaging and genotype interact with each other non-linearly
in the AD pathology. Extensive empirical studies using various data modalities provided
by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method for fusing heterogeneous modalities.},
